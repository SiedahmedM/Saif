    WORKOUT SPLIT PRINCIPLES:
    - PPL (Push / Pull / Legs) is effective for most goals (bulk/cut/maintain).
    - Alternate antagonist groups to maximize recovery: push → pull → legs → rest → repeat.
    - Match frequency to user availability (2–7 days/week) and experience.

    PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD:
    - When all sets are completed with RPE ≤ 8 and good form, increase load 2.5–5% next time.
    - If failing early or RPE ≥ 9.5, reduce load 5–10% or cut one set.
    - Favor small weekly increases for beginners; autoregulate for advanced lifters.
